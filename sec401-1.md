# Network Designs
## Conceptual Design
	- high level design
	- includes core components
	- overall purpose of network
	- major technology system, external systems for data flow, general functionality, high level system behaviour.
	- black box diagramming - single component, general role.

## Logical Design
	- detailed, inludes major components + their relationships
	- detailed data flows & connections mapped
	- for developers and security architects
	- included {services, application names, relevant dev info}
	- should not be included {server names / addresses}

## Physical Design
	- all major systems within pre-defined server areas.
	- last design before implementation.
	- details {OS, patches, versions, etc.}
	- physical constraints+limitations identfied - server components/data flows/connections.

## Communication Flow
	- Begins with logical architecture
	- Shows how data flows in and out of network
	- Maps every communication flow, exchange + control messages
	- Understand exposure and visibility of key components
	- Foundation of threat mapping

## Valuable Data
	- Begins with logical architecture
	- Where does valuable data reside?
	- Critical Intellectual Property:
		- What is the critical information?
		- Where is it stored?
		- Who has access?
		- Who should have access?
	
## Note: 
	- CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability
	- Remember: You are only as strong as your weakest link

# Attack against network devices

## Threat Enumeration
	- Process of tracking and understanding critical threats to the system or network.
	- List all possible threat agents
	- List the attack methods
	- List the System-level Objectives {(Access Data, Unintended Commands: SQLi, LDAPi), (browser script, session hijack: XSS), etc}

## Threat Agents
	- Individual, Organization or group capable and motivated to carry out an attack of one sort or another.
	- Different groups, different systems, different ways, different reasons.

## Attacks against Router

## Denial of Service (DoS):
	- router flooded with requests
	- large amount of ICMP packets sent, affecting availability

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):
	- uses zombies hosts to achieve DoS

## Packet Sniffing:
	- capture data using program that monitors network

## Packet Misrouting:
	- malicious code injected in the router to mistreat packets
	- router unable - carry out - own routing process
	- hard to find and fix: loops, DoS, etc on network

## SYN Flooding:
	- TCP synchronization packet - for malicious reasons
	- server unable to establish connection, address unreachable
	- kinda like DoS.

## TCP Reset Attack:
	- attacker terminates TCP connection with spoofed packets
