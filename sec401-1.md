# Defensible Network Architecture

# Network Designs
### Conceptual Design
	- high level design
	- includes core components
	- overall purpose of network
	- major technology system, external systems for data flow, general functionality, high level system behaviour.
	- black box diagramming - single component, general role.

### Logical Design
	- detailed, inludes major components + their relationships
	- detailed data flows & connections mapped
	- for developers and security architects
	- included {services, application names, relevant dev info}
	- should not be included {server names / addresses}

### Physical Design
	- all major systems within pre-defined server areas.
	- last design before implementation.
	- details {OS, patches, versions, etc.}
	- physical constraints+limitations identfied - server components/data flows/connections.

### Communication Flow
	- Begins with logical architecture
	- Shows how data flows in and out of network
	- Maps every communication flow, exchange + control messages
	- Understand exposure and visibility of key components
	- Foundation of threat mapping

### Valuable Data
	- Begins with logical architecture
	- Where does valuable data reside?
	- Critical Intellectual Property:
		- What is the critical information?
		- Where is it stored?
		- Who has access?
		- Who should have access?
	
### Note: 
	- CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability
	- Remember: You are only as strong as your weakest link

# Attack against network devices

### Threat Enumeration
	- Process of tracking and understanding critical threats to the system or network.
	- List all possible threat agents
	- List the attack methods
	- List the System-level Objectives {(Access Data, Unintended Commands: SQLi, LDAPi), (browser script, session hijack: XSS), etc}

### Threat Agents
	- Individual, Organization or group capable and motivated to carry out an attack of one sort or another.
	- Different groups, different systems, different ways, different reasons.

## _Attacks against Router_

### Denial of Service (DoS):
	- router flooded with requests
	- large amount of ICMP packets sent, affecting availability

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):
	- uses zombies hosts to achieve DoS

### Packet Sniffing:
	- capture data using program that monitors network

### Packet Misrouting:
	- malicious code injected in the router to mistreat packets
	- router unable - carry out - own routing process
	- hard to find and fix: loops, DoS, etc on network

### SYN Flooding:
	- TCP synchronization packet - for malicious reasons
	- server unable to establish connection, address unreachable
	- kinda like DoS.

### TCP Reset Attack:
	- attacker terminates TCP connection with spoofed packets
	- using RST(reset) bit
	- attacker sniffs TCP connection to get Source/Dest. IP, port numbers and specifically sequence number.
	- fake TCP packet created with same info but a reset(RST) bit is added.
	- data flow disrupted till new connection established.

### Routing Table Poisoning
	-Routing Table:
		- how router moves packets in network
		- created by exchanging info b/w routers
	- RTP - unwanted edits to routing table
	- broadcasted by routers

## _Attacks against Switches_

### CDP Manipulation
	- Cisco Discovery Packets
	- enabled by default on Cisco Switches
	- transmitted in clear
	- contains info about network devices
	- solution: disable CDP on non-mgmt devices

### MAC Flooding
	- Content Addressable Memory Table filled with MAC addresses.
	- Switch storage capacity overwhelmed.
	- switch acts as HUB.
	- sniff traffic along network segment.

### DHCP Spoofing
	- MITM
	- attacker-listens-DHCP	requests
	- responds-attacker IP-default gateway

### STP attacks
	- Spanning Tree Protocol
		- port altering
		- block/forward conditions to linked segments
	- Different STP attacks
	- RAW config of BPDU(Bridge Protocol Data Unit) packets
	- transitted in LAN to detect loops in Net. Topologies

### VLAN Spoofing
	- 802.1Q tags used
	- attacker- send- packets from one VLAN to another w/o passing through router

### Telnet Attack
	- Actually, distributed SYN attack.
	- Windows OS - accessible telnet executable - set up TCP session
	- conditions created for DoS attacks

# Network Topologies and Design
---

#### Physical Topologies
	- layout of how systems are connected

#### Logical topologies
	- process protocols follow to send data
